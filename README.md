🦠 COVID-19 Analysis Dashboards (Power BI) 📊

Because Who Wouldn't Want More COVID Data?

Welcome to the ultimate COVID-19 Analysis Dashboards, where we take WHO official data and turn it into stunning Power BI dashboards—because nothing says "fun" like staring at pandemic trends for hours!

🔬 What This Project Does (Besides Making You a Data Nerd)

This dashboard isn't just a collection of fancy charts; it's a deep dive into the evolving chaos that was (and still is) COVID-19. Armed with geospatial visualizations, trend analyses, and forecasting models, this project gives you the power to:

✔ Analyze and interpret global COVID-19 trends, tracking cumulative cases, deaths, and vaccination rates across WHO regions—because knowledge is power, and so is a solid dataset.

✔ Monitor weekly and daily changes in COVID-19 cases and deaths—because apparently, viruses don’t take weekends off.

✔ Forecast future outbreaks (or at least try to) using historical data—because we like playing detective with numbers.

✔ Visualize the spread of COVID-19 across the globe with geospatial mapping—essentially turning the world into a heatmap of panic.

✔ Compare vaccination rates in China, India, and the USA to understand what’s working (or not working) in each country—because science loves a good competition.


🛠️ Tools & Tech Stack

Power BI – Because Excel just wasn’t powerful enough.

WHO Official Data – The most official source we could find.

Geospatial Mapping – Because maps make everything cooler.

Forecasting Models – So we can pretend we know what the future holds.

🚀 Why This Matters

COVID-19 changed the world in ways we never imagined. This dashboard helps researchers, policymakers, and anyone with an unhealthy obsession with data to track and understand the pandemic’s trends. Whether you’re a data scientist, public health official, or just someone who loves charts a little too much, this project is for you.

So, grab some coffee ☕, fire up Power BI, and let's turn pandemic panic into actionable insights!

Feel free to fork, star ⭐, or just sit back and admire the beauty of data-driven decision-making. Happy analyzing!
