# 🦠 COVID-19 Analysis Dashboards 📊

Welcome to the *most contagious* dashboard project you'll catch today (don’t worry, it's data-only)!  
We’ve taken official WHO data and whipped up a Power BI experience so viral, even COVID would be impressed.

## 🧠 The "Pandemic Problem"

COVID-19 wasn't just a virus—it was a **global data overload**.  
Governments, researchers, and the rest of us needed to understand:

> ### ❓"Where’s it spreading? Who’s at risk? Are vaccines working? And can I go outside yet?"

This project brings clarity by turning chaos into charts and insights.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Track **global and regional COVID-19 trends**  
- Compare **cases, deaths, and vaccination rates** across WHO regions  
- Forecast future outbreaks with *crystal ball-level* accuracy (read: models)  
- Visualize the impact **over time and across borders**

## 🛠 Tools Used

- **Power BI** – To turn raw data into “wow” data  
- **WHO CSVs** – Because we trust science (and spreadsheets)  
- **Charts, Filters & Forecasts** – AKA the holy trinity of dashboards  
- **Coffee** – A required dependency

## 📊 Key Insights (Spoiler Alert!)

- 🌍 **Most Affected Region**: Varies, but you’ll be surprised!  
- 📈 **Trends**: Global cases and deaths have rollercoastered through time  
- 💉 **Vaccination Impact**: Clear progress in reducing mortality  
- 🔮 **Forecasting**: Predictive models highlight where future waves may rise

## 💻 How to Use

1. Download the repo (it’s lighter than a COVID test kit)
2. Open `COVID19_Dashboard.pbix` in [Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop/)
3. Load the CSVs (make sure they’re in the same folder)
4. Explore, filter, and nerd out on pandemic trends

## 😷 Fun Fact

At one point, the dataset had more rows than toilet paper on grocery shelves.  
Also, one of the Power BI slicers is so slick, it almost went viral itself.
