🦠 COVID-19 Analysis Dashboards (Power BI) 📊
Because Pandemics Deserve Data-Driven Drama
Welcome to the COVID-19 Analysis Dashboards, where data meets design, and insights come with a side of humor (because we all need a little laughter after surviving a pandemic). This Power BI-powered project dives deep into the numbers behind COVID-19, bringing clarity (and maybe some existential dread) to the global situation.

📌 What’s Inside?
✔ Global Trends & Insights – Analyzed cumulative cases, deaths, and vaccination rates across WHO regions. Spoiler: It wasn’t great.
✔ Weekly & Daily Forecasting – Predicting COVID-19 trends so you don’t have to. (Unfortunately, we couldn't predict 2020 itself.)
✔ Geospatial Magic – Mapping the spread of COVID-19 and pinpointing high-risk areas like a pandemic detective. 🕵️‍♂️
✔ Vaccination Showdown: China vs. India vs. USA – A comparative analysis of vaccination rates. Who won? Who lagged? Who hoarded vaccines like toilet paper?

🎯 Why This Matters?
Data-driven decisions helped shape the response to COVID-19, and this project sheds light on the critical trends that defined the pandemic. Whether you're a data nerd, a policymaker, or just someone who wants to relive 2020 in a slightly less traumatic way, this dashboard has something for you!

🚀 Tech Stack
🔹 Power BI (for dazzling visuals)
🔹 Geospatial Analysis (for mapping out pandemic chaos)
🔹 Data Storytelling (because raw numbers are boring)

👉 Check it out, explore the insights, and let’s keep learning from the past—so we can be better prepared for the next global crisis.
